# EBPP
Epic Birding Predicting Project: Predicting good birding near you

This project is currently under development.  In addition to generating "scores" in R, the backend is under construction in MySQL via RDS, and the front end with Node.JS and HTML.  

EBPP Goals:

There are three main functions for the EBPP.   

Search:  
Give date and county, it gives a descending list of species with the highest birb scores AND a descending list of birds with the most change in the last 7 days 

Graph:  
Give species and county, it gives a graph of birb scores over a year AND shows the range of dates with the most deviation 

Serve:
Give your email and county, it sends a daily form covering highest birb scores and species with the most change that day with graphs.
